# magic_the_gathering_deck_converter
There's two Shell Script in Bash to simply convert a specific generated Magic deck file into a generic Magic deck file.

For exemple: if you export a deck from Xmage and want to use it in other Magic Platform these codes may just work fine... 
Because theorically the Generic Magic Deck can be readed and comprehended by any Magic Platform, but the deck you export from some Magic Platforms are not always comprehensive for others.

For now there's just a converter from Untap, and from Xmage... But if there is some issue for others, then I can take a look. Thanks for reading, I hope this can help you getting fun.
